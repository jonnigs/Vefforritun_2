# Vefforritun 2

A selection of my projects from Vefforritun 2 (Web programing 2). The main input of the course was to use Node.js both for developing backends and frontends. Throughout the course I used a few different templating engines like, Ejs, Handlebars and Pug. For building frontends I used React.
